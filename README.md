# CSC-133 The Path

In my CSC 133 Object-oriented computer graphics programming class, I designed a java object-oriented cross-platform mobile game using codename one framework. Developed with interactive GUI, animation sound, OOPs concepts, MVC pattern, and other design patterns such as observer, iterator, singleton, and command patterns to get user's input for maneuvering ant's path to win the game by crossing highest flags without colliding with the spiders to lose life.
