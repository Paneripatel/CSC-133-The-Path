# CSC-133-The-Path

In my CSC 133 Object-oriented computer graphics programming class, I designed a java object-oriented cross-platform mobile game using codename one framework. Developed with interactive GUI, animation sound, OOPs concepts, MVC pattern, and other design patterns such as observer, iterator, singleton, and command patterns.
